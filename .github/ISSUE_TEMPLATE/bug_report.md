about: Report a bug or a problem.

This is a template for reporting a bug. You can remove it and write from scratch. These sections are a rough guide, but the important thing is to give enough details so that the developers can **reproduce** the bug on their machine and then investigate.


**Describe the bug**
A description of what the bug is. Try coping the last **steps** that caused the error. Don't forget to also copy if possible the **error log** (the message related to the error).


**To Reproduce**
Example steps to reproduce the behaviour. For instance:

1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. Scroll down to '....'
4. See error


**Expected behaviour**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.


**Screenshots**
If applicable and useful, you can add screenshots by drag-and-dropping the images in the issue window.


**System Specifications**

It's important that you give us some information about the system you are using. For that you can run:

```python
import pyllusion
pyllusion.version()
```

And copy paste the output.
